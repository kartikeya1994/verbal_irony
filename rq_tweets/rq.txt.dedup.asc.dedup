@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse "Celebrate the holidays!" What kind of liberal PC crap is that? It's CHRISTmas. Preparations are underway to celebrate CHRISTmas at the White House not Kwanzaa or Ramadan. This is an abomination!  #MerryChristmas

@WillieGeist Remember that time you sexually harassed me and propositioned me and I had to threaten to kick your ass, if you didn't stop? There you have it; the accusation has been made and people "with a moral code" should now come out against you.  You pathetic puke!!

@BrandonTucker @Tom_Nikl Most of us would like to have Fios or Google Fiber access, but apparently the previous Maryland governor made that impossible. What a nice guy, eh? #Sarcasm
Consistency? Totally nailed it ?? #Sarcasm
@nickiknowsnada @realDonaldTrump He's doing his job of distracting people with petty BS so well. That's his job, right? 
@SWStormChasers It's been snowing for the past 120 hours, what are you on about? ? 
Filed under "Killing Peter To Pay Paul" Good job Lisa () You just found a way to kill the environment, which will help kill people, in order to support a tax "reform" bill which will help kill people. Nice work if you can get paid to do it, huh? https://t.co/dJCnzeDdsh
@ShekharGupta @priyankac19 So entitlements &amp; affirmative action in the form of quotas &amp; resevatuons are "true" empowerment? Excellent suggestions 
@RepJoeKennedy @windmillcharger @POTUS That can't be. He gave his word while campaigning that he would touch both of those benefits. Isn't his word worth anything?

@AskAnshul Why would they comment on it? India is intolerant, while rest of the world (read Islamic Countries) are a beacon of progressive mindset.

@notch You mean a Free Market isn't always in the interest of the people!? COMMUNIST! 
Only Successful People that have Merit should have "unlimited internet." You need to earn, to deserve and to justify every little thing that you have access to. And you do so through having capital. Why don't you move to Cuba if you like Communism so much?
